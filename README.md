Project Done by Mark Nourallah, Zacharia Bayram, Bassem Bahsoun

Also included is the sql file

The file has been modified to not show videos since, the videos for the youtube simulator were to big to place in the file, so therefore i removed them.

I uploaded a a full demo of the project on my onedrive which you can access from here.

To get the videos working, open the server file, create a folder for videos called videos, inside the videos create 5 folders (gaming,music,cinema,news,sports). Inside them put at least 5 videos which will be directly linked to each row in the website
